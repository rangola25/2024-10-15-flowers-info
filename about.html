            This page is intended to give basic information about flowers
            because in a world where we don't stop for a moment and give a quick
            look at flowers that can remind us that we have a world to protect
            which is our home so we have no place in it, please take care of the
            environment. The flowers, spectacular in their beauty, are an
            essential element in nature. Read for fun on our website about the
            flowers and enjoy the pictures, then go out into nature near your
            home and see them with your own eyes - remember not to pick them!
