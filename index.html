            flower, the characteristic reproductive structure of angiosperms. As
            popularly used, the term “flower” especially applies when part or
            all of the reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and
            form.In their range of colour, size, form, and anatomical
            arrangement, flowers present a seemingly endless variety of
            combinations. They range in size from minute blossoms to giant
            blooms. In some plants, such as poppy, magnolia, tulip, and petunia,
            each flower is relatively large and showy and is produced singly,
            while in other plants, such as aster, snapdragon, and lilac, the
            individual flowers may be very small and are borne in a distinctive
            cluster known as an inflorescence. Regardless of their variety, all
            flowers have a uniform function, the reproduction of the species
            through the production of seed.
